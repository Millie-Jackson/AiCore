This can be discarded or saved for homemade vegetable stock. Cut the leek in half, wash in between the layers, and then thinly slice.\\nPlace a large pan over high heat and add the oil. Once hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, and salt, and cook for about 7 minutes, or until there is no moisture in the pan and the leeks have softened.\\nNext, add the spinach, crushed bouillon, thyme, parsley, and pepper and cook for about 2 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted and no moisture remains in the pan. Note if the mixture is too wet, the inside of the quiche can become soggy. Turn off the heat.\\nGrease a 9\u00bd inch (25 cm) round tart pan, and lay the puff pastry dough in the pan. Gently press the pastry down and up along the sides, just over 1 inch (3 cm) in height.\\nUse a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the dough and sprinkle the breadcrumbs along the base. Then preheat the oven to 390\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\\nEnsure that the tofu is sufficiently drained and pressed. If the tofu is too wet, the inside of the quiche can become soggy. To a food processor add the tofu, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, cornstarch, mustard, turmeric, and kala namak salt. Blend until completely smooth. Stop and scrape down the sides as needed.\\nAdd the blended tofu mixture to the vegetables in the pan and mix together.\\nTransfer the mixture from the pan to the tart pan and spread it out evenly. Rollover any excess pastry dough around the rim to create a crust.\\nPlace the halved tomatoes on top, cut side up, and bake on the centre rack of the preheated oven for 35 - 40 minutes, or until the crust is slightly golden and the top is firm to the touch.\\nLet the quiche cool off for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This time allows the quiche to firm up so it can be cut more cleanly. Enjoy!'], 'Notes': ['* Kala namak, also known as Himalayan black salt, is a salt often used in South Asian cuisine. The sulphur compounds give the salt an egg-like smell and flavour, which makes it perfect to use in a recipe like this one.'], 'Storage': ['The quiche can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.'], 'Images': [['https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/43/28/43283acc58c3570e843c70e24ab41a89.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/ca/07/ca075a40670c0aa5dc8cc83d6c351fa5.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/db/7e/db7e742548aee15f25546b954f47588f.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/97/62/97623174f4d7a48cfb170e6d2eccda43.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/ee/83/ee8389bca0e9eaabafcba10cfcde88bf.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/61/23/612392d4353f5bdb4ed16806509af2bc.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/f4/24/f424d7f92506b5066cf40f13a518ae7d.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/dd/cb/ddcbbb73e0196023259964d912ee7931.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/51/5b/515bfb4ca93bd664a1e1f40db61eacfe.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/2c/c5/2cc5fd6be511410d5da377e18e864a23.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/a2/58/a25839bd84a540d14d08a0ea62d83b23.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/20/07/20073e41619b9fb9854f38776f1d1892.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/08/60/0860bc1cc613fc27c82f9f839b20dc9c.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/5a/64/5a644d3c8db947104a092f9cdf1d9b32.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/86/ec/86ec676d3ad07a318c0ca513fe64fc03.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/c5/86/c5867e1984007baf444f521b18367bf0.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/e5/5c/e55caf83fec686cccc6821cd7064a418.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/87/a4/87a495b26b50078edebd042d8b368b19.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/2f/12/2f1270f1397ce8507385378da2a20dec.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/de/41/de415573620463b7d336e87a23a9a2e7.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/27/8f/278f4a7ccfd029b85739b89dd94fa391.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/d8/94/d894952b254e7cfad68684763ad72eb0.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/3f/81/3f81be46dad5cf1fc9715478cef9f79e.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/e7/c2/e7c2deb34366e1b889f8dfc93f9291df.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/58/7a/587a8efb4a438c22521a8b2f32d929b1.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/8b/12/8b12888665c15550794dd050ff23a8af.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/52/41/5241eeba22aa768f5036b01f09215414.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/dd/c9/ddc9b1940db9265034c9ff4f4ca84478.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/19/3e/193e01121667107bd9340264b434d0c4.jpg']]}"
