When hot, add the tofu cubes. Stir every few minutes to ensure the tofu cooks evenly on all sides, but careful to not over-stir as this can cause the tofu to crumble. When lightly golden on all sides, add the ketjap, toss to coat, and remove from the heat.\\nTo a large pot or wok on medium-high heat, add the sesame oil, shallots, garlic, and broccoli and cook for about 6 minutes.\\nTo a large heat-proof bowl or pot, add the ramen noodles and pour boiling water over top. Cover and let sit to soften for 4 - 5 minutes. We ideally want to drain when the noodles are 2 minutes away from being al dente. If using noodles that are not quick-cooking, simply cook according to the package instructions, and drain 2 minutes before they are fully cooked. Run the noodles under cold water.\\nAdd the drained noodles to the large pot containing the broccoli and shallot mixture. Also add in the bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, soy sauce, and sambal. Toss everything to coat, and continue to cook until the noodles are fully cooked and everything is heated through.\\nServe in your favourite bowls, top with desired garnish, and enjoy!'], 'Notes': ['* Ketjap is a slightly thick, sweetened soy sauce commonly used in Indonesian cuisine.'], 'Storage': ['Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.'], 'Images': [['https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/11/24/1124d6d07d7fb7a23e4ce96ceac9c39d.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/f6/f6/f6f6c0c5da729f2eda93bd364df9c265.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/f4/ee/f4ee429cb2980c0f1ed60f837cdbbebb.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/5a/3e/5a3eacbabaac2bf9b59124282746e5db.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/a6/72/a6723d2e4f5727893b054d07337ba820.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/ab/f7/abf7e460edb0ca191c975571afd8bbaa.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/7b/56/7b56dfde2eb5522cb9da2337c95c08a5.jpg', 'https://cdn.pickuplimes.com/cache/16/ca/16ca075aab187c03612d22025b6c31b0.jpg']]}"
